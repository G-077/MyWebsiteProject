\## 1. Introduction



This repository contains the source code for a responsive, multi-section static website. This project serves as a foundational demonstration of core \*\*Frontend Web Development\*\* skills, focusing on semantic HTML structure, modern CSS layout techniques (including Flexbox/Grid for responsiveness), and basic JavaScript DOM manipulation.



The website features a clean, professional design suitable for a personal portfolio, small business landing page, or project showcase.



\## 2. Features



\* \*\*Responsive Design:\*\* Optimized layout for seamless viewing on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices (using CSS Media Queries).

\* \*\*Navigation Bar:\*\* Sticky header with internal anchors for quick, smooth scrolling between sections.

\* \*\*Interactive CTA:\*\* A "Learn More" button that triggers a smooth scroll to the 'About' section using JavaScript.

\* \*\*Contact Form Simulation:\*\* Basic form validation and a JavaScript-powered success alert upon submission (without backend processing).

\* \*\*Semantic HTML5:\*\* Structure built with appropriate tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) for better accessibility and SEO.

\## 6. Future Enhancements



Potential improvements and features that could be added:



\* \*\*Multi-Page Routing:\*\* Convert the site from single-page scrolling to true multi-page navigation using routing (e.g., React Router or Flask/Node.js backend).

\* \*\*Backend Integration:\*\* Implement a server-side handler (e.g., Node.js/Express or Flask) to actually capture and store the data submitted via the contact form.

\* \*\*Dark Mode Toggle:\*\* Add a button to switch between light and dark themes using CSS variables and JavaScript.

\* \*\*Animation/Scrolling Effects:\*\* Implement CSS animations or JavaScript libraries (like ScrollReveal) for a more dynamic user experience.
